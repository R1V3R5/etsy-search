    "description": "Magical Unicorn Mane in a Bottle!  This unique totally fun Glass Bottle Necklace contains the mane from a real unicorn!  While on a quest to the very ends of the Earth I came upon a majestic unicorn with a  rainbow colored mane.  I have captured a few strands inside of this cork necklace so that you may carry them with you wherever you go.  I have heard that they do carry magical powers.  Ok, not really but it&#39;s fun to pretend!  \r\n\r\nCork has been sealed and glued to the bottle attached to a 24&quot; ball chain.  Ball chain is available in different colors: Pink, Orange, Green, Blue, Purple, Silver or Black.  The ball chain can easily be snipped with scissors to shorten.\r\n\r\nThe label is &quot;antiqued&quot; and sealed, but is not waterproof.  Please avoid submerging in water.  Bottle with cork and silver eye pin is approximately 1.5&quot; in height.\r\n\r\n***Disclaimer: No unicorns were harmed in the making of this necklace.  It does not contain hair from real unicorn.  It is a novelty item for fun and laughs only.***\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION TIME: Handmade and Made-to-Order so please allow 2-3 days to make your necklace before shipping.  Production time may be longer during holidays, if this is the case, I will announce the current timeframe in my Shop Announcement: http:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/LittleGemGirl?ref=si_shop#",

When your order ships, you&#39;ll receive an email with your Delivery Confirmation Tracking number.\r\n\r\nDuring the holidays, orders may take a few additional days to ship and the USPS may take a bit longer to deliver.  A Priority shipping upgrade is available (USPS 2-3 day transit for U.S. shipments).  If you would like an upgrade, please message me as soon as possible so I can invoice you for the upgrade. Priority shipping time frames are estimated, but NOT a guaranteed delivery service per the USPS.  Any unforeseen delays within the USPS could delay delivery of which we have no control.  For these reasons, we cannot guarantee delivery by a certain date.\r\n\r\nSome packages may require a signature confirmation at delivery.  If you are not home when the package is delivered, your carrier will leave you a notice.  You can then either pick up the package at your local post office, arrange for a re-delivery for a time when you are home, or you can sign the note and leave it for your carrier and they will leave the package for you.\r\n\r\nRETURNS: Please note that due to the nature of the following products we don&#39;t offer refunds on custom ordered items, wedding items and\/or items that have been personalized specifically for you.

Many countries assess duties and taxes on imported packages - these fees are the responsibility of the buyer. Sometimes these fees can be quite high. If you are uncertain of the amount that you could be assessed, you might want to check on it and cancel the order if you think this could be a problem. I ship quickly, so you will need to check soon (after I print the shipping label, the cancellation option is no longer available).  Any returned package that was not picked up because of a refusal to pay the customs and duties fees will not have the original shipping refunded and custom items cannot be refunded.\r\n\r\nThank you again, your business means so much to us!\r\nAndrea & Ryan\r\nLittle Gem Girl\r\n",

Although, Dishwasher cleaner can be abrasive and hand washing is always the ideal choice.\n\nSTAINLESS STEEL AND ALUMINUM DRINKWARE - CARE\nThese items are metallic they should not be microwaved.

I try to check for common misspellings but cannot be responsible for mistakes provided with an order, and for names which can have various spellings.\n\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS\nDepending on your country it can take between 2-6 weeks for your items to arrive. The time frame is dependent on the carrier service and how quickly the order clears any customs for your country.\n\nCOLOR DISPLAY ON MONITORS & IN PRINTS -\nIf your monitor is not calibrated to display correctly, what you see on your screen and what is actually true for the print you receive may be different. We calibrate our monitors and carefully manage our design colors to give prints that are as accurate as possible. Images on monitors are shown through a back light, so even calibrated monitors will display colors slightly different than on printed objects. The material that the design is printed on will affect the color as well - such as fabric, metal, ceramic, wood, etc. Inks are transparent and will print bolder and more vibrant on white, white coated, or light color items. On darker items prints will be naturally more subdued due to the darker color of the item itself showing through.\n\nHAVE ANOTHER QUESTION?\nPlease feel free to contact me anytime!\n\nORDER CANCELLATIONS\nOrders are made to order and very often we begin parts of the process for production immediately after they are received, because of this we cannot accept cancellations.
